We use deep learning and large language models to process visual and ultrasonic signal data, aiming to protect every historical building.
There are three main parts we plan to complete. First, an image recognition and processing system based on the YOLO algorithm. Second, an ultrasonic signal processing system based on large language models. Third, the development of the platform UI, which uploads the data integrated from the first two parts to the platform. Meanwhile, we will integrate the current distribution of ancient buildings in China to create a protection map. 
In the near future, we will introduce DeepSeek as the open - source foundation for our vertical large - language model in the field of ultrasonic testing.
